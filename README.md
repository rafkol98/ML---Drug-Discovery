# ML---Drug-Discovery
The dataset contains a file named drug consumption.data in the CSV format. The file contains anonymised data pertaining to drug consumption of 1885 individuals.
In this practical, we will predict nicotine consumption from 12 personality attributes (columns 2-13). You will notice that these input attributes are numerical in value, but that the target variable (nicotine, column 30) is categorical, with 7 different classes, from CL0 (Never Used) to CL6 (Used in Last Day).
